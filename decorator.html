      <p>
        This is how the home office looked like before, small with old desk and litle space to spare. It was time to change it for good!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="decor">
      <h2>Home Office Now</h2>
      <img src="img/after-ho.jpg" alt="Home Office After"/>
      <p>
        And this is how the home office looks like now! More spacious with new and bigger desk and new shelves for books, souvenirs and other stuff. I has never looked better before!
